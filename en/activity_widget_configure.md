Widget / Shortcut Configuration ![](icon_tasker.png)
----------------------------------------------------

This screen allows selection and configuration of a task which will be
performed when an icon is clicked on the Android home screen or a timer
elapses.

Please read about [Task Widgets / Shortcuts](app_widgets.html) before
venturing further on this screen.

The layout of the Configuration screen is nearly identical to that of
the [Task Edit](activity_taskedit.html) screen.

When creating a Task Timer widget, you\'ll find a different button in
the bottom right which allows initialization of the timer. You can use
this, or wait till the widget is created and then click on the icon to
configure the timer.
