### Light Level

The current light level as a (massaged) percentage of the minumum and
maximum light levels ever seen.\
\
After setting this state up, you should calibrate it by covering up the
device for a few seconds and exposing it to bright light.\
\
Warning: on at least some devices, 0% is the level of a dimly lit room,
rather than that of total darkness.\
