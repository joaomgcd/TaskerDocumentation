### Display Timeout

The length of time with no user action before the screen powers off.\
\
Setting all sliders to the maximum value means \'Never\'.\
\
Note: this setting may be overruled by the Stay On action when the
device is plugged into a power source.\
\
Note: if you go to Android settings after running this action, Android
will change the value to one it \'knows about\' e.g. if you have set it
to 9 minutes, Android Settings may change it to 10 minutes.\
Some have reported the same thing occuring after a reboot.
