#### NFC Tag

Allows you to react to a scanned NFC tag.

You can react by ID, Content or both. This allows you to react to NFC
Tags that you don\'t write yourself. For example, if you have an old key
card lying around that has an NFC chip in it, you can react to it by ID
and do your automations that way.

action.
