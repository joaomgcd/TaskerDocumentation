### Call Block

Block outgoing calls to the specified matched number(s).\
\
If no Number is specified, all calls will be blocked.\
\
If Info is checked, all diversions and blocks will be displayed after
the action.\
\
To stop blocking, use Call Revert.\
\
Note: you can\'t block \*and\* divert a particular pattern.\
\
Matching occurs in the same way as for event contexts, see the Event
Edit Activity help page.\
\
Examples:\
\
*0193\** - any number starting with **0193**\
\
*12345/56789* - either of the numbers **12345** or **56789**
