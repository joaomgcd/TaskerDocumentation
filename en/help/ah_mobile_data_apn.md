### APN Droid

Enable or disable mobile data by changing APN data.\
\
This action requires that the application APNDroid is installed on your
device.\
\
It apparently does \*not\* work for CDMA phones e.g. Motorola Droid, try
the Mobile Data action instead.\
\
If you have trouble reconnecting after using this action, use the
\'Reset to Default\' menu item in the APNs screen of Android Settings.\
\
Warning: APNDroid v2.5+: the Tasker action seems \*not\* to affect the
new APNDroid data toggle. If you use Tasker with APNDroid 2.5+, it\'s
recommended that you \*disable\* the \'Use system toggle\' option in
system settings to prevent confusion.
