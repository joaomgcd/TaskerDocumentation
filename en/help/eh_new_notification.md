### Notification

A notification has been sent to the status bar.\
\
If an Owner Application is specified, the notification must have been
sent by the corresponding package.\
\
If the notification is a duplicate of one already in the status bar, it
will still trigger the event (unless New Only is checked, on Android
6+)\
\
Other Text (Android 6+) is a collection of any other texts found in the
notification.\
\
This event is not triggered by Tasker-generated notifications.
