### Save Image

Write the image currently in the image store to a file.\
\
The file extension will only be respected for JPEG and WEBP (if
available on the device); all other extensions will result in PNG
output.\
\
Higher Image Quality values will also result in greater file size and
more chance of running out of memory. Image Quality is not relevant for
PNG.\
