### Scan Media

Force the system to scan the SD card for new/deleted media. This can
save a lot of time removing and reinserting the physical card.\
\
If a file is specified, only that file is scanned.\
If a directory is specified, all of its contents will be scanned
recursively.\
\
Note: repeatedly scanning the same file will not update the thumbnail in
Gallery.\
\
On Android 4.4+, scanning the whole card or a directory only picks up
\*new\* files and the task waits till the scan is finished.
