### Query Action

Get details of an action to run, then run it.\
\
If Action is specified, only the parameters will be queried. This is a
very useful action to assign to a home screen widget, since it allows
you to easily execute any of Tasker\'s actions without having to set up
a profile etc first.\
\
Wait and Wait Until actions cannot be queried. As a workaround, you
could query for a variable and then then Wait in the next action of the
task using the variable value.
