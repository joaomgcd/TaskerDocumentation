### Variable Cleared

The user variable (not built-in) with the specified name (or any name if
blank) has just been cleared (via action Variable Clear).\
\
Note: if multiple variables are cleared at once, (by giving Variable
Clear an empty argument) this event will only match once, and only if no
Variable name is specified for the event.
