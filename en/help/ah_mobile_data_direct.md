### Mobile Data

Set mobile data status without affecting incoming calls.\
\
This action has the disadvantage that Android may manipulate it
internally when certain things happen e.g. wifi disconnected.\
\
Note: this action requires that Mobile Data is intitially turned \*on\*
in Android System Settings.\
\
When Mobile Data is \*off\* in System Settings, this action will have no
effect.\
\
It has been reported that many Google apps reenable the setting.
