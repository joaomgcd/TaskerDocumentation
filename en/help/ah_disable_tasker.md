### Disable

Turn off Tasker's monitor and stop servicing Perform Task actions.\
\
Perform Task will fail with the message \"Tasker is disabled\" until
three-dots/Enable Tasker is selected from the Profiles, Tasks, Scenes,
or Vars screen.

Disabling the Tasker monitor is sometimes required in Kids created in
Tasker App Factory to remove them from background processing. If the
Disable action is executed in a Kid the Kid can then be run again
without reenabling Tasker's monitor.
