### Show Scene

Display a scene, creating it first if necessary.\
\
All Overlays are displayed over the current application and persist
until hidden or destroyed.\
\
Blocking overlays only block touches on the part of the screen they
cover.\
\
Non-blocking Overlays are also displayed over the Keyguard.\
\
Dialogs are little popup windows which take all user input while they
are displayed and can be dismissed with the Back key.\
\
Activities are standard Android app views.\
\
Offsets are percentages of the screen size with in the range 0-200,
(0=100% left, 100=centre, 200=100% right).\
\
Animation is only relevant for non-overlay scenes and when animations
are enabled in Android settings.\
