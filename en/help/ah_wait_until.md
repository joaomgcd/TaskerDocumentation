### Wait Until

Stop executing the current Task until the condition is met. Wait
\*maximally\* the specified time between checks. The actual time between
checks will vary because Tasker will opportunistically retest the
condition at times when battery life will be unaffected.\
\
Note: a very small wait period might have battery life implications, in
general it should be as large as is acceptable.
