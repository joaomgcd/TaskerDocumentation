### User Active

Whether the user with the specified ID is active or not.\
\
When a different user is selected, this state will become inactive.\
\
When returning to the specified user, the state will become active
again.\
\
Note that each user account has it\'s own set of apps, so to detecting
each user becoming active would require Tasker to be installed under
each account.\
\
In other words, it only makes sense to specify the user ID of the user
under which the current Tasker install is running.\
\
The administrator (first user) ID is usually 0, the action Test System
can be used to determine other user IDs.\
\
This state requires Android 4.2+.
