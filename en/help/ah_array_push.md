### Array Push

Add a new element to a variable array, pushing existing elements upwards
to make space if necessary.\
\
If Position is higher than the last index in the array, the new element
is added at the end of the array.\
\
If Fill Spaces is specified, higher elements will only be pushed up
until a non-defined element is found (which will be filled).\
\
Note: a variable set broadcast is only done for the specified array
element even if the action also causes changes in other elements.\
\
See Also: the Variables section of the Userguide.
