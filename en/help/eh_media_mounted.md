### Card Mounted

An inserted card has been registered by the system and is ready for
use.\
\
If you specify a title, only the card with a title containing the
specified characters will match this event context, thus allowing you to
do different things depending on which card is inserted.\
\
You can set the title of a card by creating a file in its base (root)
directory called xxxxx.ttl (replace xxxxx with the desired title).\
\
If you specify a Frequency and it\'s greater than 1, the event will only
match if the card has been mounted a multiple of Frequency times since
the last reboot. For example, a Frequency of 3 will match when the card
has been mounted 3, 6, 9\... times.
