### Proximity Sensor

Active when the proximity sensor of the device reports than an object is
nearby.\
\
After setting this state up, you should calibrate it by covering and
then uncovering proximity sensor a couple of times.\
\
This state may be unreliable in a profile mixed with other contexts. If
the purpose is to save power, some people have had more luck toggling
the Monitor preference instead.\
