### Sound Mode

Only works correctly on some devices (like Samsung for example)

**Do not disturb** settings on the phone may override this in some
situations

-   **Sound**: Your phone uses the sounds, vibrations, and volume levels
    you have chosen in Sound settings for notifications and alerts.
-   **Vibrate**: Your phone vibrates for notifications and alerts. This
    uses the Vibration intensity you choose in Sound settings.
-   **Mute**: Your phone plays no sounds or vibrations. Onscreen
    reminders will still occur.
