### Array Process

Perform an operation on the elements of an array as a group.\
\
Rotate shifts all the elements to left or right, and puts the end one
back at the other side.\
\
Squash removes array indices for which no value is assigned e.g. if
%var1=one and %var3=three, squash will result in %var1=one and
%var2=three.\
\
The numeric sorts use the first number they find in each entry e.g. a3c,
b5, 1x becomes 1x, a3c, b5.
