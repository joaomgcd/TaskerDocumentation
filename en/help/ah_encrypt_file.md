### Encrypt File

Encrypt the specified SD card file.\
\
The path starts in the root directory of the SD card e.g. secret.txt,
secret/recording.mp3\
\
Key Name is the name of the encryption key to use.\
\
Usually the key is deleted after encryption, set Leave Key if you have
more files to encrypt.\
\
There must be space left on the SD card at least equal to the size of
the file before starting encryption.\
\
See *Encryption* in the Userguide for details.\

You can also access Tasker\'s encryption features via File Magic, a
Tasker-integrated file manager.
