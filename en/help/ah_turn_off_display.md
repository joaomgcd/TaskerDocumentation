### Turn Off

If the display is on, it will be turned off.

On some devices it takes about 3 seconds for it to really turn off, on
others it might take around 10 seconds. Either way, a fully black screen
will be shown while the screen doesn\'t really turn off.

to unlock your screen with a password.

If Tasker has the [Write Secure Settings](ah_secure_setting_grant.html)

to work.
