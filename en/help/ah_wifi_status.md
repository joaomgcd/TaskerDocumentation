### WiFi

Whether the WiFi radio is enabled or disabled.\
\
This action is ignored when Airplane Mode is on prior to Android 2.0. It
also has no effect when a Wifi Tether (Hotspot) is enabled.\
\
Note: it\'s not usually advisable to use the Toggle setting when also
using a Wifi Near state with Enable Wifi checked, since the action will
then have different effects dependent on whether wifi has already been
auto-enabled for a wifi scan or not.
