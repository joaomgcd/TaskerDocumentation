### Silent Mode

Android 5.0: toggles vibrate mode on or off.\
\
Prior Android versions: in silent mode, all sounds except media and
alarm are surpressed by the system (without having their volume settings
changed). With Vibrate, the phone will vibrate on an incoming call.\
\
This setting overrides the Ringer Vibrate setting.
