#### Notification Settings

Allows you to open an app\'s notification settings screen.

You can optionally provide a notification category, so that the screen
opens directly on that.

Unfortunately it\'s not possible for Tasker to get other app\'s
notification categories.

::: {.inputs}
::: {.input}
::: {.title}
Package
:::

::: {.text}
The app\'s package name. If left blank, the current package name will be
used, which means that if you\'re in an App Factory app, that app\'s
package name will be used, if not Tasker\'s package name will be used.
:::
:::

::: {.input}
::: {.title}
Category
:::

::: {.text}
If set, will open the specific category instead of the notification
settings overview screen for the app. Only available for Android 8 or
above.
