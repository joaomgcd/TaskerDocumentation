### Share File

Share a file with another application or device.\
\
If Mime Type is not specified, Tasker will attempt to deduce it.\
\
If Show Chooser is specified, Android will display a selection of
possible ways of sharing the file, in a dialog.\
\
If not specified, the chooser may be shown anyway if there is no known
default way of handling that Mime Type.\
\
Some Android versions may ignore Chooser Title.
