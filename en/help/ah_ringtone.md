### Default Ringtone

Sets the default ringtone for alarms, notifications or the ringer.\
\
Music files you place in /sdcard/media/ringtones/ will be included in
the selection list for the Ringer ringtone, similarly for Notification
and Alarm ringtones. You may have to create the folders first.\
\
An easier way to use SD card audio files as ringtones is to install a
tone picker application e.g. Tone Picker.\
\
You can also just put the title of the track in the box if it matches
the title of an audio track you have on SD.
