### Element Video Control

Manipulate a Video element in a scene.\
\
Not all actions are possible at all times. For instance, Play is not
possible until the video has loaded.\
\
Tip: to simplify a manual load-and-start-video, specify in the element a
variable as the source of the video and check Start Automatically. Then
instead of using a Video Control action with Load Source, just set the
variable.
