### Notification Click

A notification in the status bar pulldown has been clicked.\
\
If an Owner Application is specified, it must match that of the
notification. Note that some apps are not reliable in this regard.\
\
If a Title is specified, the title of the notification must match it.\
\
If Tasker\'s Accessibility Service is not enabled, only notifications
created by Tasker\'s Notify actions can be detected.
