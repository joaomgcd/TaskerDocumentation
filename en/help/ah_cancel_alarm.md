### Cancel Alarm

Cancel a currently active or future system alarm.\
\
If there are two or more matching alarms, or on some devices always,
Android will show a UI allowing the user to select the desired alarm.
Therefore, for best results when automating, it\'s recommended to give
each alarm a unique label and then use that for cancellation.\
\
If the specified alarm is a repeating alarm, then only the next instance
is cancelled (the alarm remains enabled)\
\
Some modes are poorly implemented by many Android devices. For instance,
snooze time may be ignored.
