### Set Widget Label

Change the icon of the specified (existing) Task Widget on the home
screen.\
\
Name is the name of the Task which the widget performs (set when it was
initially created and initially used as the label).\
\
Label is the new home screen label for the widget.\
\
Note: if you want to change the label several times, you refer to the
\*original\* Task name each time, which does not change.
