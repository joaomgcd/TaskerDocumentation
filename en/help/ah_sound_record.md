### Record Audio

Record from the microphone to an SD card file.\
\
File is the path to the file on the SD card. It will have extension .3gp
added.\

hardware, for instance the Call source is not available on the G1.\
\
The Max Filesize is the maximum size of the resulting audio file in K.\

A zero value for Filesize places no limit, in which case the recording
will not stop until the SD card is full or the Tasker action Record
Audio Stop is performed.\
\
Note: playback of the resulting files can be done with Tasker\'s Play
Music action, amongst others.\
