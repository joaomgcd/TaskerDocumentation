### Take Photo

Take a photo. The current activity will be interrupted for a couple of
seconds.\
\
If Discreet is checked, there will be no visible or audible sign of the
picture being taken, and the device will not turn on if it is already
off (except on Eclair devices).\
\
Without Discreet, a small delay allows time for aiming.\
\
Insert in Gallery: immediately insert a thumbnail in the Gallery
application, otherwise it will not appear until the next time the SD
card is scanned.\
\
Naming Sequence: Series: photo names have an index number attached which
increases with each one taken. Chronological: the date and time is
attached to the filename.\
\
Photos are in JPG format and stored in /sdcard/dcim/Tasker/. You should
not attach the .jpg affix when specifying the filename prefix.\
