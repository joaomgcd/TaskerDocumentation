### Auto Brightness

Enable or disable automatic screen brightness adjustment by the system
(dependent on ambient light).\
\
Not available on all devices and OS versions.\
\
In some cases, though the setting is restored, the screen will not react
until the settings screen is visited. It may be therefore useful to put
Wait 500ms and Screen Brightness XXX actions in your exit task.
