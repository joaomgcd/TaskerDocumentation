### Go Home

Go to the current system Home Screen.\
\
If the Page parameter is greater than 0, the home screen is requested to
start on that page.\
\
Some of the supporting home screens are Holo Launcher, Launcher Pro,
Nova Launcher and Car Dock Home (v3). If your Home Screen app doesn\'t
support it, you could contact the developer and refer them to Tasker\'s
developer page: tasker.dinglisch.net/developer.html for info on how to
include it.
