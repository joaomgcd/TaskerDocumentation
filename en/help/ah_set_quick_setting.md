### Setup Quick Setting

Dynamically change one of Tasker\'s quick settings tiles.\
\
If no task name is specified, the tile will receive the default
appearance and functionality.\
\
The status affects the appearance of the tile in a way defined by the
system. In addition, if it is set to Disabled, the tile will not respond
to clicks.\
\
The effects of this action will only be visible when the tile is
manually added to the set of used tiles via the Android UI.\
