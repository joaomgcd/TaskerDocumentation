### Test App

Test some aspect of an application.\
\
A failed test will result in the specified result variable being
cleared.\
\
Calendar tests: require the time in seconds since the epoch as Data
(e.g. use %TIMES, or use the Variable Convert action to convert a
date/time into seconds first) and are entered in an array (%var1, %var2
etc), not a plain value, because there may be multiple events at the
time specified.
