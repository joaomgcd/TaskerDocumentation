### Decrypt File

Decrypt the specified SD card file which was previously encrypted with
Tasker\'s *Encrypt File* action.\
\
The path starts in the root directory of the SD card e.g. secret.txt,
secret/recording.mp3.\
\
Key Name is the name of the encryption key to use.\
\
The key is not deleted unless Clear Key is set, since you will usually
want to use the same key to encrypt the file again at some point.\
\
There must be space left on the SD card at least equal to the size of
the file before starting decryption.\
\
See *Encryption* in the Userguide for details.
