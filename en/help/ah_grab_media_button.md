### Media Button Events

After grabbing the Media Button via this action all presses will be sent
to Tasker.\
\
It only makes sense to do this if you configure Tasker to do something
with them (via state Media Button) or you want to block them from going
to another app.\
\
Note: any app can grab the Media Button at any time, Tasker cannot
\'keep hold\' of it. For example, the system media player seems to grab
the button at the start of each track.
