### Element Value

Set the value of a scene element.\
\
Applies only to CheckBox, Number Picker, Slider, Spinner and Toggle
elements.\
\
For a CheckBox, value should be 0 (off) or 1 (on).\
\
For a Spinner, the value is the index of the item to set.\
\
The scene must have been created first.\
\
The action can only trigger a possible event associated with the element
value if the scene is currently showing.\

To set the value of a Text, EditText or Button element, use the Element
Text action.
