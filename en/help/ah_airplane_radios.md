### Airplane Radios

Specify which radios should be **disabled** when entering Airplane
Mode.\
\
This can be useful for e.g. turning off the phone radio when it is not
required; first set Airplane Radios to only Phone, then use the Airplane
Mode action to enter Airplane Mode.\
\
Important: for some radios the setting may not take effect until the
device has been restarted.\
