### Lock

Show a lock screen.\
\
To continue, the specified code must be entered. Allow Cancel determines
whether a Cancel button will be shown or not. If Cancel is pressed the
user is taken back to the home screen.\
\
If Remember Till Off is selected, a correctly entered password will be
remembered and reused until the device enters sleep mode.\
\
A common use is to lock particular applications.\
\
Consider locking this profile. That will prevent circumvention of this
action\'s lock by changes within Tasker.\
\
Also consider attaching a Lock action to any application on your system
which would allow removal of Tasker e.g. system Settings.\
\
In any case, this action should not considered as a replacement for the
system Keyguard lock, as it is less secure. A reboot will remove the
lock screen, for instance.
