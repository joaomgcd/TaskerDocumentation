### BT Near

A matching bluetooth device is nearby.\
\
If any of the parameters are specified the device must match that
parameter, otherwise any device will match.\
\
Standard/Low-Energy Devices: if you\'re only interested in a particular
type of device, select only one of these to reduce power usage.\
\
Non-Paired Devices: selecting this will use much more power and take
longer to scan.\
\
Toggle BT: if BT on the device is disabled, enable it for the period of
the scan, probably around 5-15 seconds.\
\
A seen device which is no longer visible for approximately two times the
scan period is forgetten. This is to help prevent the profile bouncing
on and off at the edge of the signal reception area.\
\
The period for BT scanning is specified in Menu / Preferences / Monitor
/ BT Scan Time.
