### Set Clipboard

Copy the specified text to the system clipboard.\
\
If Add is set, the text will be added on the end of the clipboard,
otherwise it will replace the existing clipboard text.\
\
This is probably most useful for storing some data from an event (e.g.
the text of an arriving SMS). Note that you can also place the clipboard
contents in an action.
