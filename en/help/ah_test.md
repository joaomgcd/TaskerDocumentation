### Test

Test the value of a particular thing and put it in a variable.\
\
Failed tests will result in the specified result variable being
cleared.\
\
File tests: directories always have 0 size and their modification time
is the time a file was last added or deleted from them. File type is
either **file** or **dir**.\
\
Contact lookups are based on the phone number of the contact.\
\
Calendar values require the time in seconds since the epoch as data
(e.g. use %TIMES, or use the Variable Convert action to convert a
date/time into seconds first) and are entered in an array (%var1, %var2
etc), not a plain value, because there may be multiple events at the
time specified.
