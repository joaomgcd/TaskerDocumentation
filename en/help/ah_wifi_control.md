### WiFi Net

Change the wifi network connection status.\
\
Reassociate: reconnect even if already connected.\
\
Force: try to carry out the action even if the network status that
Android reports is incompatible e.g. disconnect even if Android reports
already disconnected.\

Report Failure: flash a short error message if the action fails. Note
that Android might not e.g. report a disconnect failure if there is
currently no connection.
