### Custom Setting

Allows you to change settings in the three Settings Tables on Android
(Global, Secure and System)

Settings whose values are 0 and 1 are usually \"on\" and \"off\"
settings. You can toggle these by setting the **Value** to
**=:=toggle=:=**

Some values can only be changed with root.

You can leave the **Value** empty and only fill in the **Read Setting
To** field to get the current value for the setting
