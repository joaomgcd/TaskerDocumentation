### Variable Add

Increase the value of the variable Name.\
\
The value is increased by the integer Value.\
\
If the variable does not contain a numeric value (e.g. 3) this action
has no effect and a warning will be flashed.\
\
If the variable does not exist, it will first be created with a value of
0.\
\
If a Wrap Around is not zero, then when the final result is equal to or
greater than the Wrap Around value, it will wrap back to 0 e.g. with
Wrap Around 5, 2 + 4 = 1.\
\
See the section on Conditions and Loops in the Userguide for more
information.\
\
Use action Variable Set for non-integer addition.
