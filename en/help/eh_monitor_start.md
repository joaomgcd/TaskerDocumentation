### Monitor Start

Tasker\'s Monitor Service has just started.\
\
Tasks triggered from this action are guaranteed to be submitted for
execution before any other and are therefore a good place to perform
preparatory actions like setting the initial values for variables.\
\
If it\'s necessary to ensure that resulting tasks finish before any
other task starts, set the Task Priority in the profile properties to
the highest level.
