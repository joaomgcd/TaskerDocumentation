### Setup App Shortcuts

Dynamically configure the list of app shortcuts which will show when the
Tasker icon is long-clicked in the launcher.\

If no task is specified, that slot will receive the default appearance
and functionality.\

This action is mainly of use for child apps created with Tasker.\
