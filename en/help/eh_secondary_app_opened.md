#### Secondary App Opened

Allows you to react to the opening of the **Tasker Secondary** app.

This can be used, for example, to launch a task with the double-tap of
the power button, instead of opening the camera, or to map the Bixby
button to a task on a Samsung device.

To check out an example of how this can be used check out [this
