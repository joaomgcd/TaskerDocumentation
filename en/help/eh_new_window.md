### New Window

A new window has appeared e.g. activity, popup.\
\
If Label is specified the label of the new window must match it.\
\
For some windows, the label might be that of the first item in the
window e.g. a menu entry or even a button.\
\
To show all window titles, leave all parameters empty and in the
resulting task add a Flash action of %WIN.
