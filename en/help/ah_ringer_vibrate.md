### Vibrate On Ringer

Whether to vibrate on an incoming call.\
\
You\'re probably really looking for the action Audio / Silent Mode if
you want to put your phone in vibrate or silent mode.\
\
Note: if silent/vibrate mode is engaged, this setting is overridden.\
\
Note: if you are going to use Tasker for this, it\'s probably best not
to mix it with other methods of controlling the setting.\
