### Notify Sound

Show a notification on the top bar and play a sound.\
\
The specified Title will appear on the bar initially. Notifications with
a particular (non-empty) title replace existing ones with that title.\
\
When the notification area is pulled down, the specified Text will be
visible.\
\
A Number other than 0 causes that number to be superimposed on the
notification icon.\
\
Music File specifies a file location on the sdcard e.g. music/hello.mp3.
If it\'s blank, the default notification sound will play.\
\
Up to 3 Actions can be specified which will appear in the notification
area. In some cases it may be necessary to slide down to reveal the
actions.
