### Set Wallpaper

Set the system (home screen) wallpaper from an SD card image file.\
\
JPG and PNG are supported.\
\
If no image is specified, the default system image is set.\
\
Scale: if the image is smaller in width or height than the
launcher-specified values, scale it up to those values while keeping the
aspect ratio.\
\
Crop: if the image dimensions (possibly after scaling) are greater than
the launcher-specified values crop it down to those dimensions. This can
be necessary to prevent Android-internal problems.\
\
Note that it can take more than 20 seconds for this action to take
effect.
