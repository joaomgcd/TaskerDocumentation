### Change Icon Set

Change Widget Task icons in the home screen.\
\
Only Widgets that have a downloaded icon can have it switched to a new
set.\
\
The New field specifies the new icon set.\
\
If no Old set is specified, all icons are changed to the New set,
otherwise only icons that currently have an icon of the Old set are
changed.\
\
Warning: for Tasker icon sets, each icon is guaranteed to exist in each
set. For user-installed icons, that may not be the case.
