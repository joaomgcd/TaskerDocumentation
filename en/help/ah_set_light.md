### Set Light

Change the brightness of a light.\
\
Available lights will vary per-device but typically include things like
keyboard backlights, LEDs, camera flashlights, display and button
backlights.\
\
Despite the maximum being given as 255, many lights will only be on or
off, in which case 0 specifies off and any other number specifies on.\
\
Note that turning a light off is not permanent, Android may turn it on
at a later time in response to various events on the device.\
\
If you accidentally reduce the display backlight to 0, a reboot should
solve the problem.
