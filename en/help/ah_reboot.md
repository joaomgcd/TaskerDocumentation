### Reboot

Reboot (or just shutdown) the device.\
\
Unfortunately, this is not a \'clean\' shutdown. Neither Android nor
running applications are informed that the device is rebooting, so be
prepared for possible data corruption.\
\
On the other hand, every other app that allows reboot does it the same
way.
