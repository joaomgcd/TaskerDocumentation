### Move

Move an SD card file or directory to a new directory.\
\
If To specifies an existing file, it will be overwritten.\
\
The paths start in the root directory of the SD card.\
\
Note: files cannot be moved from one file system to another e.g.
internal memory to SD. A workaround is to Copy and then Delete.
