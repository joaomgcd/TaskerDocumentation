### Element Text

Set the text of a scene element.\
\
Applies to Button, Text and TextEdit elements only.\
\
The scene must have been created first.\
\
For TextEdit elements, the parameter Selection specifies a part of the
text to select after it has been set.\
The specification is either a range (e.g. 1:4 for characters 1 to 4
inclusive, or 3: to select everything from character 3 onwards) or a
simple match e.g. v\*e to select everything between a v and an e. Use :
or \* to select the whole text.
