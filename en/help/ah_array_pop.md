### Array Pop

Remove an element from an array and shuffle all the higher array
elements down to fill the gap.\
If Position is higher than the last index in the array, the last element
is removed.\
\
If To Var is set, the \'popped\' value is assigned to that variable.\
\
Note: a variable clear or set broadcast is only done for the specified
array index.\
