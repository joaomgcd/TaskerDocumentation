### Ask Permissions

Bring up a permission granting dialog asking for the permissions you
specify.

Some special permissions like **Writing Secure Settings** or **Drawing
over other apps** bring up their own special dialogs.

This is meant to be used when sharing Tasks/Apps and they need special
permissions to run. You can use this action to ask for permissions prior
to using actions that need them.
