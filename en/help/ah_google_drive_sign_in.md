### Google Drive Sign In

Select an account to use with Google Drive.

If the account hasn\'t give Tasker permission to access Google Drive
yet, the appropriate permission screen will be shown.

The **%gd\_account** variable will be created with the selected account.

If **Full Access** is selected, Tasker will ask permission to access the
user\'s full list of Google Drive files and folders. Otherwise only
access to files and folders created by Tasker itself will be asked for.

**Note**: For security reasons this action can\'t be used on App Factory
generated apps.
