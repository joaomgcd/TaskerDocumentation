If the safeguard is enabled, levels less than 20 will be set to 20 to
prevent accidental black screens.\
\
Ignore Current Level: if it looks like it\'s already at the required
level, go ahead and set it again anyway.\
\
Immediate Effect: ensure the change takes effect immediately. If not
selected, it may not take effect till Android registers the new value,
which may require a display on-off.You may that find Immediate Effect
disrupts some applications.\
Immediate Effect is only needed on Android versions up till 4.4.\

If you have auto-brightness controls on your device, it\'s advisable to
disable them before attempting to set the brightness manually. See
system settings or Tasker action Auto-Brightness.
