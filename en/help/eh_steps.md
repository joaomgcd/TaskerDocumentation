### Steps Taken

The specified number of steps have been taken.\
\
The total number of steps taken since the last reset is available in the
triggered task in %evtprm1.\
\
A restart of the device, disabling the profile, disabling or
reinstalling Tasker causes the count to **reset**.\
\
When other contexts in the same profile are not active, the count is
**paused**.\
\
Requires Android version 4.4+ and that a hardware pedometer be present
on the device.\
\
When the device is sleeping, the step count will continue (without
significant power usage) and the event will be triggered on wakeup an
amount of times appropriate to how many steps were taken while
sleeping.\
\
Note: in order to improve accuracy, the response time can be on the
order of a few seconds.\
