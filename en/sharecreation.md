Sharing ![](icon_tasker.png)
----------------------------

Tasker allows you to share your setups as easy to access links that can
be opened on any browser.

The intention is to allow people to easily share their automations with
the world, in a centralized place.

Anyone can import your setups by simply visiting the shared link!

Sharing is accessed by long-clicking on a project (**not** the base
project), profile or task and selecting **Export** then **As Link**.

#### The basics to Export a Task to Link:

1.  Long-click the name of any Task, Profile, or Project. From the 3-dot
    menu in the upper right choose Export \> As Link
2.  Enter a basic or detailed general Description for your Task, then
    click the left arrow at the top left to continue.
3.  You will then see the \"Done\" dialog that gives you choices for
    where the shared link for the Task should be placed. You can share
    it to any app on your device that supports share, such as Gmail,
    etc., or, you can copy the link to your clipboard and put here in
    reddit or anywhere you\'d like :)
4.  After making your choice - Tasker will return to the previous screen
    it was on (likely Profiles or Tasks Tab) and you will notice that
    the check mark appears at the top indicating changes have been made
    in Tasker. You may ask yourself \"What changes? I simply exported a
    Task?\" and the answer is - Tasker saves the \"Description\" you
    wrote in Step 2 so that the next time you export that specific Task
    as Link you don\'t have to type it in again.
5.  Your export is complete and your shared Task/Profile/Project is on
    the Tasker server. Simply give the link created in Step 3 to anyone
    you\'d like to have Import your creation!

#### The basics to Import a Task from URL:

1.  You need a \"taskernet\" share link generated by someone who has
    Exported their Task/Profile/Project as per the steps above. The link
    begins with https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35etc
2.  Open the link on any device that has Tasker on it (with at least
    version 5.4b) typically via web browser and you will be greeted with
    the Task Data \"Import Screen\". It provides a datetime stamp of the
    most recent share/upload of this Task, along with its Title and
    basic description. To continue - simply press the green \"Import\"
    button.
3.  This will open the Tasker app and provide you with the Import
    Confirmation dialog. This allows you to proceed with or cancel the
    Import process.
4.  You\'ll also notice the \"View Description\" button on the left hand
    side. This allows you to view the full Task list of actions before
    you Import. So you can look to see if all the actions look ok to you
    (i.e. no weird File Writes or anything). There is also a \"Copy To
    Clipboard\" button there if you need an even closer inspection.
5.  Finally if all looks good to you - click \"OK\" and the
    Profile/Task/Project will be Imported into Tasker ready for your
    use! And just in case you already have a Task of the same name -
    Tasker will popup a dialog to let you choose to overwrite it or not.
    Typically you\'d overwrite if you\'re Importing a new update to a
    previously Imported Task.
6.  As a final bonus - a dialog will ask you if you want to run the Task
    / enable the Profiles right away. Or you can run them / enable them
    manually after you\'ve had a chance to peruse them in the Task
    editor :)
