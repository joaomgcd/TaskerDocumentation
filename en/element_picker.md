Scene Element: Number Picker ![](icon_tasker.png)
-------------------------------------------------

#### About

Allows selection of a numeric value from a specified range. Above and
below the selected number the element can be long-clicked to advance the
number series, or the number can be scrolled or flung up or down by
touch.

#### Events

-   [Value Selected](activity_elementedit.html#value)

Note that the Value Selected event will only fire when scrolling has
**finished** i.e. when the user has lifted their finger and the Number
Picker has come to rest.

In contrast, long-clicking will produce an event for each number that is
cycled through.
