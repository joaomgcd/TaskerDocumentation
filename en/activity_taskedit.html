<P>
This dialog allows editing of the actions in a task, and various properties
of the task.
</P>

<H4>Action List</H4>

The main part of the screen is a list of the actions contained in the currently
selected task.

<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on an action to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> on an action to enter multi-select mode and for options
	<LI><B>Click-and-drag</B> at the right hand side of the action to move it around e.g. to the trash bin
</UL>

<P>If a particular action is a <A HREF="settings.html">setting</A>, that will be indicated on
the right-hand side of the action.
</P>

<H5>Condition and Block Colours</H5>

<P>If an action has had a condition set for it, the condition is shown with
a red or green bar next to it; <B>green</B> indicates that the condition is currently met (the action will execute), <B>red</B> indicates the opposite. Of course, when the task is executed it could be that it changes things so that the condition is then met.
</P>

<P>If an action is within an <CODE>If / End If</CODE> block it is displayed
indented with a red or green margin. The colours have the same significance
as for individual action conditions described above.
</P>

<P>
If an action is within a <A HREF="flowcontrol.html#for">For loop</A> it
is displayed indented with a <B>grey</B> margin. If the <CODE>For</CODE> 
action has a condition on it which is not met, the margin will be <B>red</B>
(because the actions in the loop will never execute, like an <CODE>If / End If</CODE> block).
</P>

<H4>Task Control Row</H4>

Directly underneath the action list is a row of buttons with icons.

<H5>Play/Step Buttons</H5>

<P>Run the task.</P>

<P>
The Play button will run the task right through till the end, the Step
button will run a single task each time it's pressed.
</P>

<P>
During tasting, the current action is shown with an arrow and
the next task with a faded arrow.
<P>
The success of each action is shown when it finishes with a 
green (action OK) or red (action failed) circle.
</P>

<P>
Tasks run via the Play or Step button have priority <B>10</B>.
</P>
<P>Long-click the Play or Test button to manually set the priority 
of the task when it runs
<b>during the test</b>.  Please be aware that
setting a lower priority can result in interference from other tasks running
which are e.g. triggered by profiles.
</P>

<P>
Tip: pressing the Step button while a task is playing will cause
the task to switch to stepping mode when the current action finishes.
</P>

<H5>Add Action Button</H5>

Add an action to the end of the task. When in multi-select mode, adds an action
after the current selected item, if only one item is selected.
