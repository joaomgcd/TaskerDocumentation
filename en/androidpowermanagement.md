Android System Power Management ![](icon_tasker.png)
----------------------------------------------------

Starting with Android 5.0, many devices will act aggressively to try and
save system battery power. Unless certain steps are taken, Tasker may
not function as expected, either because Android is not sending it the
needed signals in order to save power or because Android is even killing
Tasker.

A commonly noticed symptom is that profiles with Time contexts don\'t
activate or deactivate at the expected time.

### Make Sure Tasker Is Not Killed By The OS

<div>

Making sure that Tasker is not killed by the system can be tricky
because of all the restrictions Android applies to background apps, but
in the majority of cases it\'s possible to do.
