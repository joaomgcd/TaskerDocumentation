Beginner Mode ![](icon_tasker.png)
----------------------------------

When Tasker first starts, *Beginner Mode* is enabled.

In Beginner Mode, Tasker attempts to simplify things for inexperienced
users, mostly by UI elements which are unlikely to be needed by
inexperienced users.

Beginner Mode can be disabled by unchecking the option:

> ` Menu / Prefs / UI / Beginner Mode`

Some of the changes made in Beginner Mode are:

-   main screen, Variables tab removed
-   main screen, export options removed
-   main screen, project tab not accessible
-   task edit screen, task properties icon removed
-   action edit screen, Label, Continue On Error parameters removed
-   prefs screen, many options removed
-   various places, variable selection not possible

In the userguide, when references are found to things which do not
appear on the screen. It\'s worth disabling Beginner Mode to see if
that\'s the problem.
