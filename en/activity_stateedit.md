State Context ![](icon_tasker.png)
----------------------------------

A *State Context* allows specification of the continuing state of a
software or hardware entity.

The State Edit screen allows configuration of the state and its
parameters.

#### State Name

The name of the state is given at the top of the screen. Clicking on it
allows changing to another state type.

Next to the name is a button to show help for the displayed state type
and its parameters. Be sure to check the help text if you have trouble
with a particular state.

#### State Parameters

##### General Parameters

All states have parameters to specify more details about the state.

Text parameters are treated as [pattern matches](matching.html).

##### Invert Parameter

All states have an *invert* parameter, which specifies that the context
should become active when it would usually be inactive, and vice-versa.
