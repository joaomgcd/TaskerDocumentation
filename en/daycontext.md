Day Context ![](icon_tasker.png)
--------------------------------

A *Day Context* allows specification of one or more months and/or days
of the week/month.

#### Month Specification

The months are listed at the top, any of which can be selected.
Selecting **no** month has the same meaning as selecting **every** month
i.e. has no restriction on when the profile will become active.

#### Day of Week/Month Specification

Days of the week (*Sunday, Monday* etc) and/or month (*1st, 9th* etc)
can be selected independently with the pulldown centre-right. This will
initially be for Week Days if there are any defined, otherwise Month
Days.

Selecting **no** day has the same meaning as selecting **every** day.

If you select **both** days of the week **and** days of the month, it
requires both conditions to be fulfilled for the profile to become
active e.g. selecting *Mon,Tue* and *11th* means the profile will become
active when the day is a *Mon* or *Tuesday* and **simultaneously** the
*11th* day of the month.

If you are unsure if you have specified the day(s) you require, click
the **Done** button and you will see a verbal description at the top of
the Profile Edit screen. You can click on this to try again if it\'s not
correct.
