<H2>
	Main Screen
	<IMG style="float:right;" SRC="icon_tasker.png"/>
</H2>

This is the first screen shown when you startup Tasker. It allows you
to organize and configure Tasker's four main 'building blocks':
<I>Profiles, Tasks, Scenes</I> and <I>Variables</I>.

<UL>
	<LI>Main Tabs
	<UL>
		<LI><A HREF="#profiles">Profiles</A>
		<LI><A HREF="#tasks">Tasks</A>
		<LI><A HREF="#scenes">Scenes</A>
		<LI><A HREF="#variables">Variables</A>
	</UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#action">Action Bar</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#menus">Menus</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#projects">Projects</A>
</UL>

<H3>Main Tabs</H3>

Displayed in the action bar on most devices.

<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on a tab to view a list of the relevant things
	<LI><B>Click</B> on an <b>already selected</b> tab to get options for it
</UL>

<!-- __________________________ PROFILES _________________________ -->

<A NAME="profiles" />
<H4><I>Profiles</I></H4>

Each item in the list represents a profile. The profile links contexts (conditions) on
the left to tasks which should be run on the right. The profile name is green if
the profile is active. There are three main parts to each profile.
</P>

<H5><I>1. Title Bar</I></H5>

<P>
This shows the profile name (or description if it has no name) and a
switch on the right shows whether the profile is enabled or not.
</P>
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on the name to expand / collapse the profile. When expanded, the contexts and tasks (described below), are visible.
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> on the profile name to get profile options or to drag  profile(s) around
	<LI><B>Click</B> on the switch to control whether the profile is enabled or not.
</UL>

<P>Important: the switch being set to <B>on</B> does <B>not</B> mean the profile is <B>active</B>
(will run its tasks), it means that the profile <B>can</B> become active
<B>if</B> its conditions are met.
</P>

<H5><I>2. Contexts</I></H5>

<P>
On the left hand side of the profile are an icon and text for each context in the
profile. The contexts dictate when the profile should become active. When <B>all</B> contexts
are active then the profile will be active.
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on the context to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> to show management options, such as editing or adding a new context
</UL>

<P>
You can configure what clicks and long-clicks on contexts do in <CODE>Menu / Prefs / UI</CODE>.
</P>

<H5><I>3. Tasks</I></H5>
<P>
On the right hand side of the profile are one or two tasks to
carry out based on its activation status.
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on the task to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> to show management options. 
</UL>
<P>
A task indicated with a <B>green, right-pointing</B> arrow is an
<I>entry</I> task, executed when the profile first becomes active.
</P>
<P>
A task indicated with a <B>red, left-pointing</B> arrow is an
<I>exit</I> task, executed when the profile becomes inactive again.
</P>
<P>Exception: a profile containing an event context or a repeating
or non-ranged time context has two green
arrows, to denote that both tasks are executed immediately because
the profile activation and deactivation is instantaneous.
</P>

<P>Click on the <B>Profiles</B> tab when it is already selected for
general profile-related options such as sorting.
</P>

<!-- __________________________ TASKS  _________________________ -->

<A NAME="tasks" />
<H4>Tasks</H4>

The task list shows the named <A HREF="tasks.html">tasks</A> which have been created.
<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on a task to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> for options or to drag task(s) around
</UL>
<P>
Note that a profile can be assigned an <I>anonymous</I> task (one without
a name) which is not accessible in the task list, only via the
relevent profile in the profile list.
</P>

<P>Click on the <B>Tasks</B> tab when it is already selected for
general task-related options such as sorting.
</P>

<!-- __________________________ SCENES  _________________________ -->

<A NAME="scenes" />
<H4>Scenes</H4>

The scene list shows the <A HREF="scenes.html">scenes</A> which have been created.
<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on a scene to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> for options or to drag scene(s) around
</UL>

<P>Scenes with a green name have been created but may be invisible (hidden).</P>

<P>Click on the <B>Scenes</B> tab when it is already selected for
general scene-related options such as sorting.
</P>

<!-- __________________________ VARIABLES  _________________________ -->

<A NAME="variables" />
<H4>Variables</H4>

<P>By default, all global <A HREF="variables.html">user-variables</A> that Tasker knows about are listed, which includes any that have a value set or are mentioned somewhere in a profile, task or scene.
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Click</B> on a variable to edit it
	<LI><B>Long-click</B> for options
</UL>
<P>
Note that variables whose names are all lower-case are <I>local</I> variables and not shown because they are only valid within the task that refers to them.
</P>

<P>Click on the <B>Vars</B> tab when it is already selected for
general variable-related options such as sorting and filtering.
</P>

<P>
The filter controls function as follows:
</P>

<UL>
        <LI><B>Indexed</B> (button)<BR>includes variables whose names end in a number e.g. <CODE>%LOC3</CODE>, otherwise they are excluded.
        <LI><B>Empty</B> (button)<BR>includes variables which have currently have no value assigned, deselect to show only variables that have a value.
        <LI><B>Referenced</B> (button,home project only)<BR>includes variables which are referenced in profiles, tasks or scenes.<BR>Deselect to show only 'orphan' variables.
        <LI><B>Filter</B> (textbox)<BR>excludes variables which don't contain the specified text somewhere in their name (case-sensitive)
</UL>

<P>In a user-created project, only variables referenced by that project are shown.</P>

<P>
Unlike most screens in Tasker, changes made in the variable list cannot be cancelled.
</P>
